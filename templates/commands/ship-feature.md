Ship the following feature end-to-end. Execute each step in sequence:

1. **Implement** — use @implement to write the code per the specification
2. **Test** — use @test to run the test suite; if tests fail, fix via @implement
3. **Review** — use @review to check the implementation for issues; fix any critical/high findings via @implement
4. **Document** — use @document to update relevant documentation
5. **Commit** — commit all changes with a conventional commit message (load git-workflow skill)

Do not proceed to the next step if the current step has blocking failures. Report the final status of each step.
