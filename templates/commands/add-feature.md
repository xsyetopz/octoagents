# Feature Implementation

## Task

Implement the following feature:

{{feature_description}}

## Process

1. **Explore the codebase** — Understand existing structure and patterns.
2. **Identify affected files** — Determine what needs to change.
3. **Implement the feature** — Write the minimum code required.
4. **Verify** — Build and run existing tests to confirm no regressions.

## Constraints

- Implement ONLY what is described in the feature description above.
- Do NOT add tests unless the feature description explicitly requests them.
- Do NOT add documentation unless the feature description explicitly requests it.
- Do NOT refactor, rename, or reorganize existing code beyond what the feature requires.
- Do NOT add example files, demo files, or configuration files not required by the feature.
- Match existing code style and conventions exactly.
- Make the smallest set of changes that delivers the feature.

## Context

Project location: {{worktree}}
Current framework: {{framework_info}}

## Output

Report what was done:

1. Files created or modified (with paths)
2. Brief description of changes made
3. Build/test results confirming no regressions
