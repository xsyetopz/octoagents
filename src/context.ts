Describe the project here so agents understand its purpose and domain.

## Project Features

(replace with a concise description of what the codebase builds or the problem it solves)

## Core Objectives

- (primary objective #1)
- (primary objective #2)

## Target Users

(Who uses this project? Developers? End users? Internal tools?)

List the languages, runtimes, frameworks, and tools used in the project.

## Programming Languages

- Primary language: (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, C++)
- Secondary languages: (e.g., shell scripts, SQL)

## Runtime / Package Manager

| Type | Selection |
|---|---|
| Runtime | (e.g., Bun, Node.js, Deno, Python 3.12, Rust 1.x) |
| Package Manager | (e.g., bun, pnpm, pip + .venv, cargo) |

## Build System

- (e.g., cmake + ninja, make, Gradle, cargo, bun build)

## Frameworks / Libraries

- (list key dependencies)

## Testing

| Type | Tool |
|---|---|
| Framework | (e.g., Bun test, pytest, cargo test, Go test) |
| Coverage | (if any) |

Rules that agents must follow when writing or modifying code in this project.

## Formatting Standards

| Item | Standard |
|---|---|
| Indentation style | [tabs / spaces N] |
| Line width limit | [e.g., 100 characters] |
| Final newline | Required |

## Naming Conventions

| Type | Style |
|---|---|
| Variables/Functions | [camelCase / snake_case] |
| Types/Classes | [PascalCase] |
| Constants | [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE / camelCase] |
| Files | [kebab-case / snake_case] |

## Import Standards

1. Import order: External -> Internal -> Relative
2. Import style: [prefer named imports / default imports]

## Error Handling

- (describe the project's error handling patterns)
- (e.g., always throw typed errors, never swallow exceptions, Result type)

## Comment Standards

1. Comment the "why", not the "what"
2. Public APIs: (docstring style, if any)
3. TODO format: \`TODO(author): description\`

## Git Standards

| Item | Standard |
|---|---|
| Commit format | Conventional Commits (\`type(scope): description\`) |
| Branch naming | (e.g., feat/name, fix/name) |
| PR size | Keep focused, one PR should solve one problem |
